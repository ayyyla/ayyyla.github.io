My favorite technologies are JavaScript/Typescript with ReactJS and NodeJS, Python with Django, SQL with PostgreSQL and MySQL 👩🏻‍💻. I also have experience as a graphic designer using Adobe Illustrator and Vectornator ✍🏻. I'm currently taking the Google Data Analytics and Meta Front-End Developer courses on Coursera 📖. I'm also interested in ML/AI and especially the work being done at OpenAI (GPT-4 looks so cool🥰)
